When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with others or for backup.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: Other's GitHub -> My GitHub
Clone: Github -> local
branch: local -> local

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Keep a common ancestor point, when git fetch, we can easily see what has been updated by the others.
